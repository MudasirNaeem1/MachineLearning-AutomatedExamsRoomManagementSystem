## 🎯 Algorithm Explanation

### K-Means Clustering Implementation

The system uses **K-Means Clustering** to optimize student distribution:

```python
# Core algorithm workflow
1. Student Data Generation → Domain-based feature vectors
2. K-Means Initialization → Random cluster centers
3. Iterative Optimization → Minimize within-cluster variance
4. Convergence Check → Stable cluster assignments
5. Result Validation → Balance and quality assessment
```

### Why K-Means for Exam Seating?

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Balanced Distribution** | Ensures similar number of students per room |
| **Minimize Variance** | Creates homogeneous room compositions |
| **Scalable Performance** | Handles large student populations efficiently |
| **Reproducible Results** | Consistent outcomes with seed control |
